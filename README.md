# Digit Recognizer Project


## Project Background
The project is based on the Digit Recognizer compition on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/overview/description 


The Project is about Classification of handwritten digits on the MNIST dataset.\
I will be using the Support Vector Machine and Convolution Neural Network as a classicfication methods. 

## Data Source
The datasets used is The data files train.csv and test.csv from Kaggle which contain gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits, from zero through nine.

There are 875 colomns in the train.csv which consists of a label column showing the digit of the handwritten image, and 874 columns of pixel-values of the 28*28 pixels image.
